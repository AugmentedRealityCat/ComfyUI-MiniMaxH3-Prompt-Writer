COMPACT_CONTRACT = """Write one complete, self-contained descriptive video prompt in natural language.
Use clear paragraphs describing the scene, subjects, action and camera intent. Be concise without removing necessary detail.
This is Compact output: do not use the official Base/Reference section schema, task-type prefix, subject_definitions, retention_analysis or frame-alignment boilerplate. Do not return JSON, commentary or Markdown fences. This output contract overrides formatting directions in Sequence Instructions and neighboring prompts; retain their creative constraints.
Retain useful request-local <Picture N>, <Video N> or <Audio N> literals when they identify actual supplied media, explaining each used role naturally in prose. First constrains only the supplied opening and Last only the supplied ending. An appearance reference does not supply a new scene. Do not invent media labels. Audio is declared context, not analyzed sound.
Local timing still runs from zero to the target duration. Use a timestamp only where timing matters; never output global chunk labels. A chunk boundary is not a cut. Preserve requested dialogue, progression, camera intent and style.
After the standalone description, end with exactly these two fields, each on its own line:
overall_soundscape:
A short natural description of scene-grounded audible sounds. Modest obvious sounds such as footsteps, fabric rustle or room ambience are appropriate; do not add events or elaborate sound design. Preserve requested speech or singing as sound from the scene.
non_diegetic_music:
N/A unless the raw brief or instructions request music; then briefly describe only the requested music. An explicit no-music request means N/A. Singing or scene sound alone does not request background music. These two sound fields are required, including for quiet scenes.
Start from the current preceding prompt, develop this interval's allocation and reach its intended ending. Establish enough scene context for this prompt to work independently. Never replay a completed event just because the temporal plan mentions it."""
