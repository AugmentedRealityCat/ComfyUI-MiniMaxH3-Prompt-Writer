PLAN_INSTRUCTIONS = """Allocate the user's requested development over the supplied video intervals. Return only the JSON below. This temporary temporal plan allocates content; it does not establish a second version of the scene.
The brief and explicit instructions govern intent. Existing prompts marked KEEP, including manual edits, are fixed scene evidence: fit missing or revised intervals between their actual endings and openings without replaying completed events. For refinement, change only the requested interval. Never plan a replacement for a KEEP interval.
Plan the requested kind of progression: movement, interaction, speech, changing light, atmosphere, or a sustained state. An interval need not contain a new physical action. Preserve ordered events and their explicit timing. Keep short actions naturally paced; do not stretch one gesture over several intervals or move its execution earlier than its assigned time. If the brief names a concluding action or endpoint, reach it in the final interval unless the user places it earlier. Earlier intervals may prepare for a short concluding action, but perform that action within its assigned interval rather than splitting its execution across boundaries. If no conclusion is requested, end in a natural continuing state without inventing one. A frame boundary is not a stop, cut, or freeze.
Use only brief-grounded developments and modest natural transitions, without adding story, people, consequential props or locations. Honor requested camera behavior; otherwise do not invent camera moves or cuts. First/last frames constrain only the supplied boundary; their pixels are not available here, so defer visual facts to the writer rather than guessing them. The writer will read the actual accepted predecessor and effective media.
Use exactly {"steps":[{"progression":"what develops or continues during the interval", "ending":"what is true at its end, including ongoing activity"}]}. Return one step for each interval marked generate=true, in chronological order. Keep both strings concise. Do not duplicate appearance, scene inventories, the brief, or KEEP prompts. No indexes, extra keys, media labels, commentary, or Markdown; explicit event timing may be included in progression."""
